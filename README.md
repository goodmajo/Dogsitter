# Dogsitter
This program controls an RPi, 2 relays, and 2 HC-SR501 PIR sensors. It tracks whether your dog is upstairs or downstairs, and turns a light on in his/her location if it's after sunset. The code can easily be edited to accommodate more sensors and relays.

This is a work in progress and is, as of right now, pretty much pseudocode as it has not yet been tested yet at all. Do not clone this repo and expect it to work!
