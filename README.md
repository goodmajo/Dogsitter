## What it is
This program controls an Arduino, an RPi, 2 relays, and a number of sensors. The Arduino acts as a signal processor for the analog sensors, and the RPi handles the system's output.
## What it does
It tracks whether my dog is upstairs or downstairs, and turns a light on in her location if it's after sunset. It also tracks the noise level in the house, and if there is nearby construction or a garbage truck outside, it plays white noise over the stereo. Finally, it logs the temperature in the house over the day.
