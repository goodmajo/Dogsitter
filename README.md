## What it is
This program controls an Arduino, an RPi, 2 relays, and a number of sensors. The arduino acts as a signal processor for the analog sensors, and the RPi handles the system's output.
## What it does
It tracks whether my dog is upstairs or downstairs, and turns a light on in her location if it's after sunset. It also tracks the noise level in the house, and if there is nearby construction or a garbage truck outside, it plays white noise over the stereo. Finally, it logs the temperature in the house over the day.

This is a work in progress and is, as of right now, pretty much pseudocode as it has not yet been tested yet at all. Do not clone this repo and expect it to work.
